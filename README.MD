## What is Scastie ?

Scastie is sbt in your browser. You can:

* Use any version of Scala
* Use an alternate backends such as Dotty, Scala.js, Scala Native, and Typelevel Scala.
* Use any library published on Maven.
* Share Scala programs with anybody
* Embed Scastie into your own website or library user guide.

## How does it works ?

When a user evaluates their code, the browser sends all its input to our server.
We run your code in an isolated Java Virtual Machine on our servers.
We integrated a scaladex interface to allow you to search the Scala ecosystem
and include any published Scala library in your project. You donâ€™t need to
remember what the latest version number of a specific library is anymore!

The output will be streamed back to the user. A specific protocol will allow
the client to interpret different events such as compiler errors,
runtime exceptions, instrumentation, console output, etc.

We also enable a worksheet mode, which feels much like a worksheet in an IDE.
This lets a user write code as top-level expressions, without having to put
code inside of a class or object with a main method. Worksheet mode gives you
two ways to interleave your results; on the one hand, when an expression
is evaluated, you can see the value and type of the evaluated expression
to the right of the code that you wrote. On the other hand, worksheet mode
also makes it possible to do a kind of literate programming; that is, you
may interleave code and HTML blocks much like in notebook environments
such as iPython notebooks.

## How do I embed Scastie ?

You can embed a snippet with two different way. You can embed a ressource that
was previously saved or you can convert code to a snippet.

### Embedded Ressources

Any ressource saved can be embed via a script tag by appending ".js".

```html

<!-- Annonymous Ressource -->
<script src="https://scastie.scala-lang.org/xbrvky6fTjysG32zK6kzRQ.js"></script>

<!-- User's Ressource -->
<script src="https://scastie.scala-lang.org/MasseGuillaume/CpO2s8v2Q1qGdO3vROYjfg.js"></script>
<script src="https://scastie.scala-lang.org/MasseGuillaume/CpO2s8v2Q1qGdO3vROYjfg/1.js"></script>
```

### Converting Code

It's also possible to convert code into a snippet. The preffered way is to embed
a snippet since it's output is cached. This mode will compile and run the snippet
every time it's accessed.

```html

<pre class="simple">
1 + 1
</pre>

<pre class="scala-js">
import org.scalajs.dom
import org.scalajs.dom.raw.HTMLImageElement

val img = dom.document.createElement("img").asInstanceOf[HTMLImageElement]
img.alt = "such dog" 
img.src = "https://goo.gl/a3Xr41"
img
</pre>

<pre class="full">

</pre>


<!-- Embedding Script -->
<script src="https://scastie.scala-lang.org/embedded.js"></script>

<script>
window.addEventListener('load', function() {
  var Scastie = com.olegych.scastie.client.ScastieEmbedded;

  // DOM selector without build options
  Scastie.embedded(".simple");


  // with some options
  Scastie.embedded(".scala-js", { targetType: "js" });

  // all option
  Scastie.embedded(".full", {
    // General
      theme: "light", // (dark, light)

    // Inputs
      // if not set, it will use the code available in the selected dom element
      code: "1 + 1",
      worksheetMode: true,

      // you can add anything here that sbt supports (libraryDependencies, scalacOption, etc)
      sbtConfig: 'libraryDependencies += "org.json4s" %% "json4s-native" % "3.5.2"',

      // Scala-Native is not yet supported: https://github.com/scalacenter/scastie/issues/50
      targetType: "jvm",  // jvm, dotty, typelevel, js
      
      scalaVersion: "2.12.3"
      // setting Scala.js version is not yet supported: https://github.com/scalacenter/scastie/issues/228
  });
});
</script>
```
