Those people have access:

* @MasseGuillaume
* @heathermiller
* @julienrf
* @jvican
* @olafurpg

2. You need to be a member of the scalacenter on dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/u/scalacenter 

3. do`docker login`

3. You need sbt, nodejs and docker

4. bump the version in build.sbt

5. tag and commit the new version
