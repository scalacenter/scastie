## How to run locally

requirements: 

* node (for less)
* phantomjs (for running client tests) ```npm install -g phantomjs```
* `export SBT_OPTS = "-Xms512M -Xmx1536M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled"`
* sbt
* docker (for deploying)

```
sbt
> sbtRunner/reStart
> ~server/reStart

# How to deploy

## Requirements

1. To deploy the application to the productions servers (scastie.scala-lang.org) you will need to have ssh access to the following machine:

* `scastie@scastie.scala-lang.org`

Those people have access:

* @MasseGuillaume
* @heathermiller
* @julienrf
* @jvican
* @olafurpg

2. You need to be a member of the scalacenter on dockerhub: https://hub.docker.com/u/scalacenter 

3. do`docker login`

4. bump the version in build.sbt

5. tag and commit the new version

6. Run this command locally: `sbt deploy`

7. Make sure everything went well: https://scastie.scala-lang.org


## Running with docker locally

`docker run --network=host scalacenter/scastie-sbt-runner:0.16.0`
