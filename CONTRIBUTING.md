## How to run locally

### How to install prerequisites via nix

```
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
nix-shell -v
```

### How to install prerequisites on Mac
```
brew install openjdk@17 sbt nodejs yarn
```

### How to install prerequisites on Windows

Assuming you use Git for Windows >= 2.16.2.1 (note this will erase uncommitted changes):
```
git config --add core.symlinks true
git reset --hard HEAD
```
```
choco install nvm yarn sbt openjdk17 python3
nvm install 8.9.1
nvm use 8.9.1
```
(npm >= 9.0.0 may have issues finding/using python)


### How to run the sbt build

```
sbt
> startAll
```
in a separate terminal, start the vite dev server by running `yarn dev` in the root directory of the repository

open `http://localhost:8080`

then run `~client/fastLinkJS` if you work on client part 
or `~sbtRunner/reStart;server/reStart` if you work on the server part. 

you can also open `http://localhost:8080/embed.html` to edit the embedded style

### Testing production build

Start the sbt production server:

```
sbt
> startAllProd
```

open `http://localhost:9000`

## Scalafmt

Make sure to run `bin/scalafmt` to format your code.

You can install a pre-commit hook with `bin/hooks.sh`

# Let's talk

If you have any questions join us in the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/scalacenter/scastie)

# How to deploy

## Preparing sbt environment
The whole deployment process is done semi-automatically via SBT task.

```
ssh scastie@alaska.epfl.ch
ssh scastie@scastie-sbt.scala-lang.org
docker login
cd ~/scastie && git pull && ~/nix-user-chroot-bin-1.2.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl ~/.nix bash -l
nix-shell -v
sbt
```

## Publishing images
To deploy new version of scastie, you need to first build and push docker images.
In order to do it, you should run `publishContainers`.
You should do it only when you're sure that containers are working as intended.

Using this task automatically replaces `latest` image on the docker repository.

## Deployment

Scastie offers multiple deployment configurations with following instructions for each of them.

If you didn't make any changes to the deployment task, it should finish with success.
Otherwise, the deployment will fail and inform you that remote deployment scripts are not up-to-date with their
local counterparts. In such situation you should follow the instructions from the sbt console.

Every IP which is put into the configuration should be double-checked. If you have any doubts if they are correct, please
contact one of the maintainers.

### Production

Scastie production environment is used for internal deployment. Its configuration is present at `./deployment/production.conf`.

Production requires `mongodb-prod.conf` file to be in the same directory as `production.conf` configuration file.
The template for this file is located at `./deployment/mongodb.template.conf`

It also requires OAuth2 configuration at `oauth2-prod.conf` in the same directory as `production.conf`

<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>

```
ssh scastie@alaska.epfl.ch
ssh scastie@scastie-sbt.scala-lang.org
docker login
cd ~/scastie && git pull && ~/nix-user-chroot-bin-1.2.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl ~/.nix bash -l
nix-shell -v
sbt
```

In case docker images are not published e.g. when staging for the current version is not deployed,
it must be done before proceeding with the production deployment. It is done by running:


```
sbt> publishContainers
```

Then deployment can be started by running `deploy` sbt task.

```
sbt> deploy
```

</details>

### Staging

Scastie also has a staging environment. The deployment can be done by running the task `deployStaging`.
It will do normal deployment, but with Staging environment configuration file located at: `./deployment/staging.conf`

Staging requires `mongodb-staging.conf` file to be in the same directory as `staging.conf` configuration file.
The template for this file is located at `./deployment/mongodb.template.conf`

It also requires OAuth2 configuration at `oauth2-staging.conf` in the same directory as `staging.conf`

<details>
  <summary>Instructions</summary>

```
ssh scastie@alaska.epfl.ch
ssh scastie@scastie-sbt.scala-lang.org
docker login
cd ~/scastie && git pull && ~/nix-user-chroot-bin-1.2.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl ~/.nix bash -l
nix-shell -v
sbt

sbt> publishContainers
sbt> deployStaging
```

</details>

### Dry run

Scastie deployment process generates shell scripts responsible for proper remote deployment.
If in any case you want to check the scripts without running them, it can be done by running
`deployDryRun` sbt task.

## Reverting the deployment

The deployment process is sequential, so if the process fails on any step, it will be stopped, so only one part of the system
will be affected. You will need to manually restart failed step.

## Check logs
```
ssh scastie@alaska.epfl.ch
ssh scastie@scastie.scala-lang.org
tail -F -n1000 output.log
ssh scastie@scastie-sbt.scala-lang.org
~/log.sh
```

## Full

0. You need access to `scastie@alaska.epfl.ch`, `https://github.com/scalacenter/scastie-secrets`, `http://scala-webapps.epfl.ch:8081` and be a member of `https://hub.docker.com/u/scalacenter/`

These people have access:

* [@julienrf](https://github.com/julienrf)
* [@rochala](https://github.com/rochala)
* [@fsalvi](https://github.com/fsalvi)


0. see `production.conf` file for current production configuration, notably it uses mongodb instead of local file storage 

0. Install docker (note that Windows is not recommended due to networking issues)

0. do `docker login`

0. bump the version in build.sbt

0. tag and commit the new version

0. Run this command locally: `sbt deploy`

0. Make sure everything went well: https://scastie.scala-lang.org

## Restarting

In case anything goes wrong:

```
ssh scastie@alaska.epfl.ch
ssh scastie@scastie.scala-lang.org
ssh scastie@scastie-sbt.scala-lang.org
./production/deploy-runners.sh
./production/deploy-metals.sh
exit
./server.sh
```

# Running with docker locally

Running with docker locally works only with linux for now ( it won't work on macOS )
It can be started by running `sbt deployLocal` command.
